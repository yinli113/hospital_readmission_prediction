# Hospital Readmission Prediction

## TL;DR
A machine learning project to predict hospital readmissions. This project aims to identify patients at high risk of readmission to improve care quality and reduce costs.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prototyping.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the source code.
- `data/`: Directory for datasets (ignored by git, place your data here).
- `docs/`: Documentation.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
